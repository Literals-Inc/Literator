LITERAL SDK LICENSE AGREEMENT
By downloading or using the Literal SDK (the “SDK”), you and, if applicable, the company or entity that you represent (collectively, “you” or “your”) are consenting to be bound by and are becoming a party to this SDK License Agreement (“Agreement”) with Literals, Inc. (“Literal”).  If you are entering into this Agreement on behalf of a company or other entity, you hereby represent and warrant that you are authorized and lawfully able to bind such company or entity that you represent to this Agreement.  If you do not have such authority or do not agree to all of the terms of this Agreement, you may not download or use the SDK.  
LICENSE GRANT.  The SDK is licensed and not sold.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Literal hereby grants you a non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, non-transferable right to incorporate the SDK into your mobile applications (“Your Applications”) and distribute the SDK solely as integrated in Your Applications for internal use of Your Applications (and not for further distribution).

You acknowledge that your use of any components provided with the SDK that are licensed under an open source software license (“Open Source Components”) are not part of the SDK licensed hereunder and are subject to and governed solely by the terms of the applicable license(s) for those components, and not by this Agreement.

RESTRICTIONS.  Except as otherwise expressly authorized herein, you will not directly or indirectly: use, disclose, modify, sublicense, sell, assign, distribute or otherwise exploit in any manner the SDK; remove any proprietary notices or branding from the SDK and/or use the SDK in violation of any applicable laws or regulations or otherwise outside of the scope of the license granted herein.  In addition, you will not directly or indirectly obtain or attempt to obtain the source code for the SDK by any means, including reverse engineering, decompilation, disassembly, translation or similar manipulation of the SDK, unless and only to the extent that applicable law in your jurisdiction specifically gives you the right to do any of the foregoing.  You will immediately notify us of any unauthorized use, access to or disclosure of the SDK of which you become aware.

OWNERSHIP.  As between you and Literal, all right, title and interest in and to the SDK, and any copies or portions thereof, shall remain with Literal and its suppliers or licensors.  You understand that Literal may modify or discontinue offering the SDK at any time without notice.  The SDK is protected by the copyright laws of the United States and international copyright treaties.  Nothing in this Agreement gives you a right to use any of Literal’s trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand features, except to the extent the same may be embedded by Literal in the SDK’s interface.  Literal does not grant any and reserves all rights not expressly and unambiguously granted herein.

SUPPORT AND UPGRADES.  

If Literal provides you with any updates, upgrades, patches, enhancements or fixes for the SDK that it makes generally available free of charge in connection with the SDK, then the items that are provided will become part of the SDK, as applicable, and subject to this Agreement.  

You shall, at your own expense, be solely responsible for providing technical support and training to your customers for Your Applications, and Literal shall have no obligation with respect thereto.  You shall be solely responsible for, and Literal shall have no obligation to honor, any warranties that you provide to your customers or to end users with respect to the SDK or Your Applications.

INDEMNITY.  You agree that Literal shall have no liability whatsoever for any use you make of the SDK, Your Applications or Open Source Components, including in relation to any warranties you provide with respect thereto.  You hereby agree to indemnify and hold harmless Literal and its affiliates, and each of their directors, officers, employees and agents, from any and all damages, liabilities, losses, costs, and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) resulting from third party claims arising from Your Applications or your use, distribution or other exploitation of the SDK, Your Applications or Open Source Components.

WARRANTY DISCLAIMER.  LITERAL PROVIDES THE SOFTWARE, DOCUMENTATION AND OPEN SOURCE COMPONENTS “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY OF ANY KIND AND HEREBY DISCLAIMS, FOR ITSELF AND ITS LICENSORS AND SUPPLIERS, ALL EXPRESS AND IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, PERFORMANCE, ACCURACY, RELIABILITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF PERFORMANCE, COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE IN TRADE.  THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE AGREEMENT.

LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.  NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING ELSE, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL LITERAL OR ITS LICENSORS OR SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON WITH RESPECT TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT UNDER ANY CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, WARRANTY OR OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY, FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, LOSS OF DATA, COSTS OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS, SERVICES, TECHNOLOGY OR RIGHTS, INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS, ACCURACY OF RESULTS, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR OTHER DAMAGES IN EXCESS OF ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS (US$100), EVEN IF AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

BASIS OF BARGAIN.  YOU AND LITERAL EACH RECOGNIZE AND AGREE THAT THE WARRANTY DISCLAIMERS AND LIABILITY AND REMEDY LIMITATIONS IN THIS AGREEMENT ARE MATERIAL, BARGAINED FOR BASES FOR THIS AGREEMENT AND THAT THEY HAVE BEEN TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT AND REFLECTED IN DETERMINING THE CONSIDERATION TO BE GIVEN BY EACH PARTY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT AND IN THE DECISION BY EACH PARTY TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT.

TERMINATION.  Each party may terminate this Agreement and the license granted herein at any time.  Upon termination, you must destroy or remove from all hard drives, networks, and storage media, all copies and extracts of the SDK.  All remedies for breach, and Sections 2 through 12 (but not 4.1), shall survive any termination of this Agreement.  YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT TERMINATION OF YOUR RIGHTS TO THE SOFTWARE MAY CAUSE YOUR APPLICATION(S) TO NOT OPERATE PROPERLY, AND LITERAL WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY OR RESPONSIBILITY WHATSOEVER AS A RESULT THEREOF.

EXPORT.  You shall comply with all laws, rules and regulations of the Department of Commerce, the United States Department of the Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”), and other United States or foreign agency or authority, and not export, or allow the export or re-export of the SDK in violation of any such restrictions, laws or regulations.  By downloading or using the SDK or exercising any of the rights granted in this Agreement, you are agreeing to the foregoing and representing and warranting that you are not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of any country to which the United States has embargoed good or services or similar restrictions, and you are not identified as a “Specially Designated National” by OFAC, you are not placed on the U.S. Commerce Department’s Denied Persons List or any similar lists, and you will not access or use the SDK if any applicable laws in your country prohibit you from doing so in accordance with this Agreement or limit the terms of this Agreement.

GOVERNMENT RESTRICTED RIGHTS.  The SDK is deemed to be “commercial computer software” and “commercial computer software documentation,” respectively, pursuant to DFAR Section 227.7202 and FAR Section 12.212, as applicable.  Any use, modification, reproduction, release, performance, display, transfer or disclosure of the SDK by any agency, department or other entity of any government, shall be governed solely by the terms of this Agreement and shall be prohibited except to the extent expressly permitted by the terms herein or in a writing signed by an authorized signatory on behalf of Literal.  No other rights are granted. 

MISCELLANEOUS.  This Agreement contains the complete agreement between you and Literal regarding the SDK and supersedes all prior agreements and representations between you and Literal regarding the SDK.  This Agreement may only be amended and any provision may only be waived by a writing executed by both parties.  You agree to promptly provide Literal with all information and documentation that Literal requests to verify your compliance with this Agreement.  If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable, it shall be reformed to the limited extent necessary to make it enforceable.  This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of California, without regard to its conflicts of laws provisions.  The courts located in the County of San Mateo, California, will have exclusive jurisdiction and venue under this Agreement.  You may not assign or transfer any part of this Agreement to any third party.  Literal may assign and transfer this Agreement without consent to an affiliate or successor to all or substantially all of its business or assets to which this Agreement relates.  Any breach of this Agreement by you would cause irreparable injury to Literal for which no adequate remedy at law exists, and you agree that equitable remedies, including injunctive relief and specific performance, are appropriate remedies to redress any such breach or threatened breach, in addition to all other remedies available.  As used herein, “including” means “including without limitation”.
